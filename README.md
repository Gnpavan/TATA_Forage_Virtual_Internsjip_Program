# **TATA Virtual Experience Program by Forage**

## **Project Overview:**

An online retail store has hired you as a consultant to review their data and provide insights that would be valuable to the CEO and CMO of the business. The business has been performing well and the management wants to analyse what the major contributing factors are to the revenue so they can strategically plan for next year.
Social Buzz has over 100.000 posts per day, that can be assumed to have 36.500.000 posts per year. We will analyze the sample of this dataset from them.

## **Project Findings:**

Above is the dashboard I have built with the dataset received fromthe social media buzz team. They wanted to understand the better performing categories, top posts by cntent, basically their focus or aim was to understand how well they could engage the audience with their posts.

- Content wise they are preety much good as the posts have no big margin.
- They were able to generate more posivity as most of their posts were well recived of around 70%.
- Animals, science, healthy eating, food and technology are amoung the top 5 by the posts.

## **Project Recommendations:**

- As the week goes on the number of posts are getting reduced, it's better to engage the audience especially the saturdays as it fuells up the sunday spirit.
- Looking at the sentiments % of the posts yes there are of 70% good posts but the positive posts are 56% and the negative are 32%, so understanding audience choices is necessary maybe by conducting online surveys, categorizing audiences by age groups might be some of them to tackle the issue.

## **Project Outcomes:**

- Completed a simulation focused on advising a hypothetical social media client as a Data Analyst at Accenture
-	Cleaned, modelled, and analysed 7 datasets to uncover insights into content trends to inform strategic decisions.
-	Prepared a PowerPoint deck and video presentation to communicate key insights for the client and internal stakeholders.
